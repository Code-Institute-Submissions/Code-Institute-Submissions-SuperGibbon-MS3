# Cook Book - A place to find and share recipes

This project is designed to be place where users can come to find recipes or share recipes that they want the world to see. The project is linked with selling kitchen utensils and by including a link on the recipe page where utensils are shared it helps with brand recognition and potential sales. (in this case the brand is John Lewis, there is no official allifiation with the company)

## UX

It has been design to be simple and nice on the eyes and easy to use, the pages use a white and green colour scheme throughout and easy navigation using a navbar on the top of the page (sidebar for smaller devices)

## Wireframes

Wireframes were designed using Miro, they can be found here
